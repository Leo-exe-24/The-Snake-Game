<h1>The Snake Game</h1>
    <p>The Snake Game is a modern take on the classic snake game, built using Unity. This project was created as an assignment for my Game Development course. The art and sounds were provided by my course instructor, Matthew Dickson. Players control a snake using the mouse to collect eggs while avoiding mines and the game borders. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible.</p>
    
<h2>How to Play</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the mouse to control the snake's movement.</li>
        <li>Eat eggs to grow longer.</li>
        <li>After collecting 4 eggs, a special egg will appear. Eating the special egg increments the round.</li>
        <li>For every round number, a mine is placed at a random location in the playable area.</li>
        <li>Avoid mines and the game border to stay alive.</li>
        <li>Try to achieve the highest score possible.</li>
    </ul>
